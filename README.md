# How does crAIg work?
crAIg is a uses Neuroevolution to learn how to play Mario. Neuroevolution is the artificial evolution of neural networks through genetic algorithms. In simpler terms, crAIg evolves much like species do, selecting for success every generation.

crAIg started out knowing nothing about Mario, or even what a game is. All crAIg starts with is a list of inputs and outputs, and he uses these to learn how to play Mario.
